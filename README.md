# detuned-excitation
Simulates a two-level system in interaction with a laser field,
namely a pulsed laser.
The goal is to achieve high excitation of the upper energy level using a detuned laser pulse (approx. 10-20meV detuning).
Usually, resonant or chirped pulses (which are at some point resonant) are used to excite such systems. 
Our approach is a detuned laser, which changes its detuning with approx. the momentaneous Rabi-Frequency. 
The Rabi frequency changes throughout the pulse, since it is proportional to the envelope function of the laser pulse.
Alternatively, a continuous wave (cw) laser could be used which would allow for a constant modulation of the laser.
